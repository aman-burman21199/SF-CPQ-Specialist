- Quote lines flagged as `optional` do not sync to the opportunity, which keeps forecasting accurate. `Optional` flag is set on QLE. The QL's total is not added to Quote's total. Itâ€™s worth noting that quote lines flagged as optional are never counted in the aggregated quantity for a DS (field - Aggregation Scope). Optional items are meant to show customers what is possible, not what they actually get.

- To know which Quote fields are `Calculating Fields` (one that CPQ knows might affect prices in some way), go to Calculating Fields Field Set on the quote object.
